"DotA2","Why do low MMR core players hate BKB so much?","What's the lore implication for that? I just lost a game because our carry Jugg refused to buy BKB and dived the t4 when all he had to do was hit the fucking t3.

"DotA2","If you are convicted of griefing, please implement a -100 MMR","I had a game where I DD because we have a great lineup.

"DotA2","Not playing your role in ranked role queue should receive heavier punishments.","That is all.

edit: Since some Heraldos are confused, allow me to clarify. No one is trying to stifle creativity here, I didn't say anything about restricting hero picks. Pick whoever the fuck you want, just play your role. Don't want to play your role, don't queue for role pick. It's very simple.","371","1785","2023-03-23","16:24:22","False","True"
"DotA2","Ranked roles is awesome!","Anyone agree that ranked roles changed Dota for the better? Show valve some feedback.

1. Less ruiners
2. People who play pos5 actually want to play the role now
3. You get to actually practice and perfect your role since you can reliably play the same role.

"DotA2","Since Valve is listening to suggestions recently, can they release the percentiles for ranked mmr?","The last time they did was in 2013 right before ranked came out, which showed us the percentile of unranked mmr rankings, which is very likely outdated by now. Other popular competitive team games like Overwatch and League of Legends all have data provided to the playerbase to let them know where they stand. It would help if Dota 2 had such a system as well.","414","2118","2017-05-02","04:18:41","False","True"
"DotA2","Valve can we please get ranked roles permanently as a feature?","Some games are lost as soon as the drafting phase starts.

So I’ve come to the conclusion there is no such thing as the promised land when it comes to matchmaking. Every bracket is equally shit as the other. Just going to sit back enjoy the shitshow from now on.","206","706","2022-06-27","16:57:43","False","True"
