ApexLegends     ,Is this technically gonna end up being the most rare skin in the game?                                                                                                          ,"Always wanted to ask . Since the major backlash apex received when they released this skin that was 160$ (entire collection event) . This skin is probably never coming back right ? Since they can’t really bring it into the “recolor store” because the 50 exotic shards isn’t equal to the value you had to pay to get it originally and players who unironically did buy it would be upset it’s being sold for half the price .

Is it forever gonna be a skin you could only get one time and it’ll never return ? Not that I’d want it or anything . I just genuinely think it’s interesting to wonder what this skin and its history will be . And if instead of ever trying to return this skin they just recolor it again and put it in the exotic shop. But even then the players who bought the 160$ one would be mad there’s a recolor of a skin they payed 160$ for that’s available for 40-50"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,      94 ,    422 ,False             ,False

To make that happen, we’ll be running this tournament with several live broadcasts across different languages, with the main stream being hosted on [twitch.tv/ogesports](http://twitch.tv/ogesports) and featuring casting from OG staff and a few friends.

Reach 35k score to get 5 tokens and a Spleen Decoration. There were cases of not reaching 35k even though I completed all 5 levels. I eventually got 40k because I had 7 minutes left over, so time is a big part of getting to the highscore.

It's a Survivor.io-esque game with 3 playable characters: Dragonus, Shen, and Kez. There are currently 7 difficulty options as well as an upgrade system that requires both Tokens and Gold that you get from the minigame. The rewards for completing all the difficulties are a Jugg Set Style Unlock (the coolest style, by far), three all chat voicelines (Your reckoning comes!, Somebody, do something!, Pathetic). Currently I'm OG-ing the hell out of the enemies in ranked by spamming ""Pathetic"" all the time. Insanely fun minigame.

Probably glitched and they’ll fix it sometime.

I took too long to finish Act 2 and was sorta slow on Act 3 and didn't really have the motivation to make a guide for those parts and I'm not really planning to. I managed to somehow finish Act 4 in like 3-4 days though and I sorta have the motivation to write this one.

Looking back on all the previous Battle Passes that I've had to max, this one definitely feels the most fun and least chorelike out of them all. Pretty much everything gameplay related is either as good as or better than it has been in any of the past BPs imo. I'm really glad they decided to try something new for this year instead of sticking to the tried and tested because it really feels like they hit the nail on the head. Can't wait for the next year's event to be just as good or better.

For the sake of my own convenience/laziness, this guide is gonna assume you've read the Act 1 guide. I'm gonna be using the same format and I won't bother explaining anything I already have in that guide. If something has changed/is new, I will mention those of course.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  First of all, in terms of gameplay/number of games required, Act 4 should be slightly faster to max out than the other 3 acts. This is due to the Token Trader having the same options as Act 3, the map having 3 starting points compared to just having 1 like the others and last but not least, none of the nodes seem to require more than 3 tokens at a time to access (no 4, 5 or 6 token nodes which were present in some of the previous acts). However, the tradeoff is that the minigames take slightly longer to potentially finish. It should still be faster overall to finish it though. The Questing Hearts node which was in Act 2 yet absent from Act 3 makes a return and it's new and improved. You can send up to 3 tokens per day instead of just 1 and the interface shows what tokens each of your friends require, saving the hassle of having to ask them everyday.

If you have a problem identifying which is where, please do ask so in the comments. Leaving the minigames for last.

You have 3 options:
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  1) Exchange any 4 tokens for 2 tokens, you won't receive the same ones you put in - I avoid using this one, doesn't really feel like it's worth it.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  2) Trade any 2 Tokens for 3 scrap - Pretty useful near the end to finish off the last nodes you'd need to finish

                                                                                                                                                                                                  **Shifty Busko's Blade Hustle:** Just gives you a matching off-hand for the immortal weapon you'd have if you bought the pathfinder pack for Act 1

You need to cross lv 1 at least to be able to progress in the story. Up to 5 levels available. Left click to reveal, right click to flag, 1 + left click to use the ability (costs 50 mana to safely reveal a spot, won't kill you even if you have a bomb). There's a clarity that pops up which restores 25 mana and a clock that gives you 30 seconds if you left click either of the spaces that have them. Note that said spaces might not be safe and right clicking them moves them to an adjacent space or removes them if there's no adjacent unrevealed/unflagged spaces. The clarity/clock will also disappear after 5 actions (right clicking their specific node takes 1 turn off that specific one leaving the others unaffected, right clicking other nodes does not consume an action/turn). Clicking on a revealed number (say 1) after you've flagged all adjacent bombs will auto reveal the unmarked spaces in a single action.

Just like minesweeper completing the bare minimum to proceed is simple enough to not require any real strategy but if you want to max out the stars, keep this in mind.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  You're expected to defeat all enemies with a certain number of bombs remaining per level in a specific time to get max score. The time thing won't really be a problem most of the time and it's just completing them with as few bombs as possible really. Different kind of bombs don't have different points attached and some parts of the puzzle can be solved with more than 1 approach. The power bar also leaves a line behind that indicates the last position you released at. My advice would to solve the puzzle 1 section at a time, identify which ones are harder to execute than others and then just retry going from hardest to easiest sections. If you need help with a specific one, do ask and I can share how I solved it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                  Can't think of a relatable title in specific, just every dungeon clearing game ever. You have to kill all the enemies and then find and open the section, some walls can be bombed and some can't. 3 powerups exist, red ones make ur bombs bigger and go through breakable walls (explosions otherwise don't spread beyond those walls when they come in contact with them), green ones are remote mines which can be detonated, last kind allows you to kick the bombs to reposition them (works even on enemy bombs). You have 3 lives and coming in contact with any enemy or a bomb explosion (yours or theirs) will kill you, enemies can't walk through bombs and you can get blocked by them soon after placed as well (there's a short window where u can sorta walk through em). There's also buffs that increase your bomb count (allows placing more bombs simultaneously) as well as increasing bomb explosion radius and character movement speed. I believe clearing level 4 or whatever is the bare minimum to progress, this one might take more effort than the previous 2 to complete the bare minimum for.

                                                                                                                                                                                                  The big one. Honestly deserves a separate post of its own which I do plan on maybe making. For the sake of keeping the guide short I'll keep it simple and just list out one of the many potential strats you could pick to clear this. There are 7 levels and you only need to clear the easiest one to progress the story, the other rewards as cosmetic so not really worth it if u don't enjoy the mode but the mode itself is pretty fun so I can see myself maybe trying to max it out. There's an upgrade shop where you can upgrade your char with coins, most upgrades also require tokens in addition to coins. At the time of my first (and so far only) complete run, I've only had lv 1 each of the max hp, hp regen, damage anda move speed upgrades with the rest unupgrades and it can definitely be completed even without these 4 if you don't wanna waste time grinding tokens. The higher levels probably do requires more upgrades though so keep that in mind if you aim to grind it. Anyway here's the strat.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  1) Pick Dragonus aka Skywrath Mage. Each of the 3 chars starts with their default spell + an innate specific to the hero, Dragonus has the innate that synergizes best with what we're going for so we're gonna pick him and build around the innate.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  2) Characters cast spells automatically when they're off cooldown + have a valid target (usually an enemy) in range. Items are passive and upgrade either the character or the spells or both. Defeating enemies drops xp (can be Blue, Purple or Red in order of xp, stronger enemies drop purple/reds) outside of Roshans (drop item chests) and Mini bosses (drops aghs upgrades).
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  3) Your character has 5 ability slots and 6 item slots. The first ability slot is used by the ability tied to your character. Every level up you will be offered a choice from 3 random abilities which could either be an upgrade or a new ability. Your character has no upper limit for their level (or at least there doesn't seem to be one). All abilities can go up to level 9. Item slots work the same, you're offered the choice from 1 of 3 items either a new one or an upgrade to an existing one. Some items only exist at lv 1 while others can be upgraded to level 2 and most can even go to lv 3. You can't replace items or abilities so once your slots are full you will only see upgrades. Once all your items are maxed, picking up item tokens will instead grand ability levels.

Also while I mentioned having 5 ability slots and 6 item slots, one of the items we're going for gives a bonus ability slot (essentially trading an item slot for an ability slot) so I'll be listing 6 ability builds with the assumption that we'll be getting said item. Also do keep in mind, this guide is just made with the first level in mind, I have not done higher levels so I can't confirm its effectiveness there.

The other 2 you wanna get pretty much every game (the best 2 to get imo) are Magic Missile and Laguna Blade. Make sure you grab magic missile as early as possible in particular. These 3 are gonna be top priority, the best single target nukes that are projectiles, having these speeds up the final boss kill a lot. For the other spells u just want waveclear to make it to the boss, chain frost is typically the strongest out of the lot in this build, frostbite is worse at waveclear but has value against stronger enemies, mortimer's has decent range, annihilation would be perfect if it were magical instead of physical (would work perfectly in a shen build), rot is magical but isn't projectile and is sorta useless against the boss. You also wanna grab one waveclear ability early if possible but prioritize the 3 main abilities obviously. Chain Frost is the best to grab out of the waveclear stuff if you're unsure. Track boosts up other stuff but i'd rather just get another ability. Stampede is nice for the movespeed but otherwise meh. The bat is QoL to help with item pickups but I don't think the QoL is worth an ability slot.

Magic Missile aghs scales off units killed with Magic Missile and it is retroactive which is why grabbing the spell itself as early as possible is recommended. Laguna with aghs melts the bosses. Annihilation aghs is an ok 3rd slot maybe since the extra life can come in clutch. Track aghs is worth mentioning if you're forced to grab the spell, you essentially trade away one aghs for more ability points (since the extra item tokens end up being converted to ability ones) but you will typically max out the 2 important ones, maybe all 3 of the best ones even without this.

At the start of the game you will have 2 item chests and 1 magnet visible on the map. We will move towards the item chests 1 by 1 ignoring the magnet for now. You will also encounter a roshan or two along the path. Do remember to pick up exp if its convenient but don't feel too pressed to collect every bit. Always pick up item chests though.

Killing these provides you with an aghs scepter which gives u a choice from 3 of your abilities (randomly picked) to select an aghs upgrade.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  7) At minute 12, the mob stage ends and you're ready to fight Queen Imperia.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  8) Gameplan is to run towards the first 2 items and grab them. The magnet grabs all the exp on the map so we wanna save it for later. Then chill until minute 3 and then walk towards the minibosses, repeat for minutes 6 and 9. Grab the magnet when ur starting to get overwhelmed and need a boost, ideally save it for either between the 2nd and 3rd boss (minutes 6 to 9) or at the end after beating the 3rd boss.

                                                                                                                                                                                                  Both of these bosses are easy to beat but take a while to kill.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wailing Mass is a ball that follows you around, its pretty easy to kite but when it hits you it really hurts, I've almost died to it a couple of times so make sure to keep your distance. It dies pretty fast tho, should be pretty free.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Forgot the name of the last one but this is the only real threat imo. There's 5 skeleton archers but only one of them will take dmg (the others will have their models blued out in the meantime). You have to kill them one by one and they all shoot fire arrows which sorta hurt, i've died to this one a few times.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  9) For the imperia fight, most of the attacks are telegraphed/dodgeable, outside of one where she spams the field with projectiles, I kept dying here until I realized there's 4 pillars in there that can block these projectiles. Everytime I killed her she only used this move thrice so making sure you're always near a pillar shound ensure u never die, lina and venge spells with aghs will destroy her in the meantime.

Since I live here, I decided to grab some tickets. I know very little about Rinbow 6 Siege in general, so I decided to start watching the swiss stage. After 20 hours of watching pro Siege for the last couple of days, I can say with the utmost certainty that I have no idea what is happening at anytime, ever.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Now I've worked in the eSports industry as a caster for the last half decade, and a trend among the games I've cast over these last 5 years, is that they are easy to understand for everyone, even for new viewers who had never played the game before. Rocket League especially, is just high intensity car soccer. A toddler will understand the rules of the game after watching a single 5 minute game. Anyone can watch pro Rocket League, and understand what is going on after just 1 game. Perfect for eSports.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trackmania, Formula 1, and most other racing games with a professional scene. Racing itself is very intuitive, and while rules change from game to game, the car thats ahead is always first. Any new viewer can come in, open the stream, and understand the main goal within minutes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  What about CS then? Counter-Strike and Valorant is very complex compared to Rocket League or Trackmania, there's more moving parts, there's multiple objectives and a new viewer won't understand the game immediately. CS and Valo are a lot like ice hockey in this sense, where the objective itself isn't complicated, but the rules and nuaces are. Ts want to Plant the bomb and make it explode, or kill all the CTs before time runs out, while the CTs want to defuse the bomb before it explodes or kill all the Ts before they have the chance to plant the bomb, first to 13 wins. The objectives are easy to understand and a new viewer will intuitively understand what the goal of the game is after watching a single game. It takes more than 5 minutes to understand the main goals of CS and Valo, unlike Rocket League and Trackmania, but just like those games, just 1 match is all you need to understand the main objective. Counter Strike especially, doesn't require 1000 hours in the game to understand how the game works. After watching 3-4 matches, you know what every piece of utility does, that there is an economy and teams need to be careful about, that each point of interest on the map has a name, and that big rifle guns have a better chance of winning against pistols. By the end of your 3rd or 4th game of pro CS, you know what some of the terminology also means, and why it is done, such as saving. Valorant we'll come back to later, after we finish talking about Hero Shooters.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Before looking at the problem children of eSports, let's look at the last intuitive game type you'll find in eSports, that being the battle royale games. PubG, and Fortnite are the biggest games in this category, and is intuative, similar to CS at the pro level. After 1 game, you understand the objective is for the solo player or for the entire team is to be the last survivers. The premise is like free for all dodgeball, and everyone knows how to play dodgeball. There's some house rules depending on the game, but you'll learn them as you watch, but even when not fully understanding the rules, similarly to CS, you know what is going on for the most part.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Lets take a look at every other big esport from the perspective of someone who has never watched them before. I'm talking about the MOBAs, and Hero Shooter games, League of Legends, Dota 2, Rainbow 6 Siege, Apex Legends, and Overwatch. All 5 of these games have multiple complex objectives that are unintuitive to anyone that hasnt seen these games before. Let's start with the MOBAs first. It took me a few hours of watching Dota 2 and LoL to know that a midlaner is the player that stays in the center line, offlaners are the players on the outer lines, and the junglers play in between these ""lanes"". Beyond this very basic premise, I have no idea what their individual objectives are, other than to eventually converge with their teammates and destroy the enemy base. In a straight gun fight, even in a game like Siege, Valorant, or CS, I know whats going on for the most part. However, as I don't have 1000 hours in either Dota, or LoL, I have no idea what is going on in any fight, ever. I never understand what caused one team to win or lose a fight. Nothing about MOBAs is intuitive to the average person, and often times, even players with 1000 hours fail to understand something that happened within the game. Both games are beyond complex and require the equivalent of a PhD to understand what is going on completely.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  We have finally arrived to the Hero Shooters. Taking a very basic premise and objective, and giving it a MOBA amount of complexity. If Counter-Strike is ice hockey, Valorant is also ice hockey, but every player is wearing a different coloured jersey, while handling a unique stick that does something different to the puck when hit, and then to top all that off, every player plays by different rules. To anyone that knows anything about ice hockey, imagine if Player A is allowed to punch everyone in the face without getting a penalty, but no one else could do this. Now give each of the other 9 players a similar rule breaking thing that no one else can do. After doing all this, you've finally created Ice Hockey Hero Shooter. Ok so I've explained how Valorant works, simple premise with a bonkers amount of complexity, but at least the game is somewhat intuitive to new viewers. After watching 3-4 matches, you understand the basic premise, and also understand that the game goes very deep in its complex rules, and thus you'll require 1000 more matches before you fully understand the game. Some people like this, some don't and that's fine.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Then you have the final 3 games I named earlier. Not only do these games have an incredibly bloated amount of complexity, but the premise of these games makes no intuitive sense. Apex Legends is easy to explain, it's the Valorant version of Fortnite, you now know the basic premise of Apex Legends. Have fun thinking you understand what's going on and never actually understanding anything ever.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Rainbow 6 is even harder to explain, because there is no comparable basic concept. As a new viewer, nothing makes any sense until gun fights start to happen, and even then, how or when the gun fight took place is beyond comprehension, you only understand that a gun fight took place. Rainbow 6 is basically the movie Inception played at 1.5x speed. That is legitimately the best description I can give. I have watched over 20 hours and still understand basically nothing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Overwatch is going to be the last topic of today, and Overwatch might be the most complex of them all. Not only do you retain the Hero system, but the game itself has multiple different objectives with multiple different ways of playing them. Sometimes you push a payload, sometimes you capture a point of interest on the map, sometimes its something else. In total there are 6 different competitive game modes you can partake in a professional Overwatch game. 6 different objectives that changes after every few minutes. As a new viewer, the best way to describe pro Overwatch is a Valorant version of a team based decathlon. However because there's 6 different events, it should technically be called a sexathlon...god I love the English language. Overwatch, basically, as an eSport, is 6 different events, back to back, played as a team, where every player on said team plays by wildly different rules.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                  So what makes CS one of the best eSports then? It's more complex than other games such as Rocket League and Trackmania, while also not having the deep complexity that comes with the MOBA or the Hero Shooter genre. As a viewer, after watching your first few games, you understand the basic concepts, and the why's and how's a team wins or loses a game. It also leaves you with the knowledge that you dont know everything and that the game has a lot more nuaces to offer. If you decide to dive headfirst into CS, you will find hidden complexity everywhere, from jumpthrow lineups to prefire angles. It's perfect for casuals to watch, as the basic premise is easy to understand, while also letting viewers understand that the game is full of small complexities they can learn along the way as well. Games like CS, Rocket League, and Trackmania make for great eSports. It's such a shame that both Rocket League and Trackmania are being killed by their own parent companies, and in that regard, it's why CS is doing so well as an eSport. A game anyone can watch and understand, while not being killed by its own creator."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,      13 ,     18 ,False             ,True
